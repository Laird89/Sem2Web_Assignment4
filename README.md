Semester 2 web programming assignment 4

More DOM manipulation and more practice with functions.

This project is a simple web application that dynamically generates and displays a list of book categories. Users can click on a category, and the application will show a list of books within that category, including the book name, author, and a thumbnail image. Additionally, the project provides a search functionality where users can input a book name, and it will display a message if the book is found.
